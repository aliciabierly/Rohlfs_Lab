# Rohlfs_Lab

This repository contains scripts I have created while working in the Rohlfs lab. Our goal in this project is to investigate the broad role of TRs across the genome in adaptive archaic introgression. I am continuing to work at this lab until graduation, so this repository is continuously being updated!

## Project Structure:
* /data : contains metadata of information about individuals included in this study (from 1000KG).
   * /data
* /notebooks : contains jupyter notebooks for analysis of individuals.
* /scripts : contains bash and C scripts used in Talapas to perform analysis on genomes of individuals in the study.
