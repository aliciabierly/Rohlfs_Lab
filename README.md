# Rohlfs_Lab

This repository contains scripts I have created while working in the Rohlfs lab. Our goal in this project is to investigate the broad role of TRs across the genome in adaptive archaic introgression. I am continuing to work at this lab until graduation, so this repository is continuously being updated!

## Project Structure:
* **/data** : contains metadata of information about individuals included in this study (from 1000KG).
* **/notebooks** : contains jupyter notebooks for analysis of individuals.
* **/scripts** : contains bash and C scripts used in Talapas to perform analysis on genomes of individuals in the study.
   * /archive : contains scripts created while testing packages that are not used in the final studies
   * /processing_data : contains codes created to process raw genomoic data
